I am Vasudha Varadarajan, a postdoc at CMU LTI (since August 2025) working in the areas of NLP: understanding and modeling the human cognition as it manifests in conversations between humans as well as with LLMs. I am interested in applying NLP techniques to problems in computational social science to study socio-psychological phenomena through language use at scale, active learning, and improving conversational AI for psychometric surveys. I am also interested in interpretability and explainability of language models, and exploring NLP for low-resource and code-mixed settings. I did my PhD under the mentorship of [H. Andrew Schwartz](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~has/) in the State University of New York at Stony Brook.  I am fortunate to be mentored by [Maarten Sap](https://maartensap.com/) and [Mona Diab](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html) at LTI.

I am always looking for opportunities to work with teams with similar interests. Other than that, I love facilitating discussions and teaching!
