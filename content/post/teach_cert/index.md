I mentored a high-school student from NJ on "Language of Neurodegenerative Patients and their Caregivers on Social Media". They have been inducted into American Junior Academy of Sciences (AJAS) and invited to present their work at American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual meeting in 2026.
